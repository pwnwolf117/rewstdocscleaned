### **Introduction:**

In this video, Brandon covers how to identify the right tasks to automate. These are tasks that are time-consuming, involve high volumes, or are prone to errors. To avoid "setting your house on fire," prioritize tasks that minimize risks, align with compliance or regulatory requirements, and cater to customer demands. Automation can transform intricate, time-consuming processes into seamless, value-driven experiences.

### **Rules of Automation**&#x20;

As you embark on automating your chosen processes, consider these rules to ensure effective implementation:

1. **Problem Solving**: Automation should address at least one of the problems mentioned earlier: time consumption, high volume, or error-proneness.
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Ensure that the task can be automated using available tools and integrations, including compatibility with Rewst.
3. **Defining Success**: Clearly outline the desired outcomes of the automated process. Specify inputs, outputs, and the overall transformation you aim to achieve.
4. **Maintenance Planning**: Just like a light switch that needs maintenance, anticipate potential maintenance requirements for your automated processes. Be prepared to update and optimize over time.
5. **Modularity**: Seek opportunities to create modular components that can be reused across various automation tasks, enhancing efficiency and consistency.

### **Success with Automation Over Time**&#x20;

Success in automation doesn't require building complex processes from the start. Starting small is key to gaining value quickly. Begin with a small process, witness it working, and gradually expand. With each success, you'll develop patterns and strategies that empower you to build more advanced automation.

### **Leveraging Available Resources**&#x20;

To achieve your automation goals, tap into the resources at your disposal:

1. **Rewst Actions**: [Rewst provides a host of actions](../../documentation/workflows/actions-in-rewst/rewst-actions/) that serve as building blocks for your MSP automation. Leverage these to construct your workflows.
2. **Community Support**: Join the vibrant [Rewst community on Discord](https://discord.gg/Rewst), where customers share insights, solutions, and ideas. Participate in events [Open Mic Fridays](../../updates/roc-open-mics/) to learn from fellow users.
3. **Educational Opportunities**: Explore [Cluck University](../rewst-foundations-10x/) courses tailored to enhance your skills for automation. These courses equip you with the knowledge needed to excel in your automation journey.
