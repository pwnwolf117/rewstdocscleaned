There is a known issue with the initial Crate Trigger Enabled slider not working as expected. To ensure the trigger is disabled, make sure the trigger is disabled during the unpacking configuration.&#x20;

Leveraging crates in Rewst will help you set up your first out-of-the-box automation. Unpacking a crate means you get all the forms, triggers, and workflows that your automation needs to run smoothly.

Our team has built over 120 crates and is still building more.&#x20;

### **Ensure Integration Setup**

Before unpacking crates, make sure your integrations are set up. If you need help with that, check out the [setting-up-your-integrations.md](setting-up-your-integrations.md "mention") video.

### **Accessing the Crate Marketplace**

* All prepackaged crates live in the Crate Marketplace.
* Generally created by our ROC team, some crates are also contributed by the broader Rewst community.
* All crates are free for you to use as needed.

### **Navigating to Crate Marketplace**

* From the dashboard, use the side menu to navigate to **Crates** and then **Crate Marketplace**.
* You can use the search bar to find specific crates. For now, select **Getting Started Crates** and filter by that tag.

### **Selecting and Unpacking Crates**

* These crates are the ones you want to unpack first.
* Crates in this section have the **Getting Started** tag in the bottom quadrant.

### **Unpacking the Add Client to Rewst Crate**

* Click on the crate to open it.
* Under the "What's being installed" section, there are three collapsed lists: **Workflows**, **Triggers**, and **Forms**. Open each to see what's included.

### **Reviewing Triggers**

* Always review the trigger section before unpacking the crate.&#x20;
* Any crate from the Getting Started section is marked safe to install immediately. Checking the trigger is toggled off is a good habit.

### **Authorizing Integrations**

* Click **Unpack Crate**. If there are any prerequisites (e.g., authorizing Microsoft integration), it will be indicated.
* Click **Continue** if prerequisites are already met.

### **Configuring the Crate**

* In the crate configuration settings, the most important is to add your time savings for accurate reporting.
* Find the enabled toggle under trigger settings and turn it off before unpacking.
* Select **Unpack**.

Make sure the trigger is enabled for the proper organization when you are ready to go live!

### **Final Steps**

* Larger crates might take a while to unpack, but the process will continue in the background.
* Unpacking a crate won't make the automation run; you need to turn the trigger on for the work to happen.
* Open the workflow to review it before enabling your trigger. Check the connected form and update any necessary settings. When done, press **Submit** to save.
* The side panel provides additional information about the crate and all connected workflows.
