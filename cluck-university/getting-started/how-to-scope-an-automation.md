### **Introduction:**

When considering the initiation of a new automation, remember that you cannot automate a process that doesn't exist. It's vital to document and understand each step of the process.

***

### **Examples of Processes Commonly Automated:**

* Onboarding new users.
* Offboarding terminated users.
* Documenting users and groups.
* Billing reconciliation.

***

### **Steps to Scope Out an Automation:**

1. **Document the Process**: Before automating, write out the entire process. Understand each step thoroughly.
2. **Begin with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Start with the most fundamental aspect of the automation, make it functional, and then iterate.
3. **Visualize the Workflow**: Using tools like Roost, or even on paper, draw out the flow of the process. It helps in understanding the entire workflow and in troubleshooting any hiccups.
4. **Consider All Contingencies**: Make sure to consider all possible paths, troubleshooting steps, inputs, and outputs.
5. **Implement & Test**: Once scoped out, implement the automation and rigorously test it.

### Expert Insight from Will Young of Bering McKinley

Will shared how he automated a task in Hubspot to send activities to Connectwise Manage. This simple 3-step automation saved the company hours of work and ensured data synchronization between Hubspot and Connectwise Manage.

_Objective_: Extract specific activity or event data from Hubspot and create an activity in Connectwise Manage.

_Steps_:

1. Get Hubspot to send information to Rewst.
2. Extract the required data from the information sent.
3. Use the extracted data to create an activity in Connectwise.

### **Conclusion**:

Automation, when properly scoped and implemented, can save significant amounts of time and reduce manual effort. Always begin by understanding the process thoroughly, and then proceed to implement and test the automation.
