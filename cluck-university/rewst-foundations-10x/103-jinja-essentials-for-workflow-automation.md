### Part 1: Live Editor

The [Jinja Essentials](../../documentation/jinja/jinja-essentials.md) doc is a great resource to reference if you get stuck along the way.

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Open the Live Editor with Sample Context Data and Jinja</summary>

**Open the Live Editor**

1. **Open** the [Live Editor with some sample data.](https://app.rewst.io/jinja-live-editor?id=4ee84407-d0c1-4a9a-94b3-84c643b8dd3f)

Here are some important keyboard shortcuts you can use throughout

1. Remove comments
   * Windows: _ctrl + /_
   * OSX: _cmd + /_
2. Render code
   * Windows: _ctrl + enter_
   * OSX: _cmd + enter_

</details>

<details>

<summary>Step 2: Start by viewing the basic CTX Attributes</summary>

**Expressing all the CTX Attributes**

1. **View JSON Context:**
   * Open the Context editor to view the JSON context.
2. **Uncomment CTX:**
   * **Initially**: `{# {{ CTX }} #}`
   * **To view**: Remove comments as shown in Step 1. Render `{{ CTX }}`.
   * **Revert**: Re-add the comments to return to `{# {{ CTX }} #}`.

**Show the Value of the Week**

1. **Display Week Value:**
   * **Initially**: `{# {{- CTX.week -}} #}`
   * **To view:** Uncomment, render `{{- CTX.week -}}`, and follow Step 1 for removing comments.
   * **Revert:** Re-add comments to return to `{# {{- CTX.week -}} #}`.

**Show Days in the Schedule**

1. **Display Schedule Days:**
   * **Initially**: `{# {{ CTX.days | length }} #}`
   * **To view**: Uncomment, render `{{ CTX.days | length }}`, and follow Step 1 for removing comments.
   * **Revert**: Re-add comments to return to `{# {{ CTX.days | length }} #}`.
