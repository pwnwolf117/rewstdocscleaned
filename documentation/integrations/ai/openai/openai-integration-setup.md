# OpenAI Integration Setup

## Setup

By leveraging the OpenAI API, Rewst.io can tap into advanced natural language processing (NLP) models and AI capabilities provided by OpenAI. This integration allows Rewst.io to offer intelligent text analysis, generation, and understanding, enabling users to interact with the application in more intuitive and efficient ways.

1. **Log in** to OpenAI.
2. **Navigate** to the API Keys page.
3. **Create** a new secret key for Rewst to use.
4. **Navigate** to the integrations page in Rewst.
5. **Click** on the OpenAI integration.
6. **Copy** the secret key from OpenAI and **paste** it into the API Key field in the Rewst - OpenAI integration form.
7. Optionally, if you belong to multiple organizations, you can **specify** the OpenAI Organization ID to use.

## Actions

### Chat Completions

Given a chat conversation, the model will return a chat completion response.

| logit\_bias        | String (?) | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the endoftext token from being generated. |
| user               | String (?) | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.

For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.The maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you need more than this, please contact OpenAI.</td></tr><tr><td>echo</td><td>String (?)</td><td>Whether to return the prompt in addition to the completion.</td></tr><tr><td>stop</td><td>Array</td><td>Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.</td></tr><tr><td>presence_penalty</td><td>String (?)</td><td>Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details">See more information about frequency and presence penalties</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>frequency_penalty</td><td>String (?)</td><td>Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details">See more information about frequency and presence penalties</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>best_of</td><td>String (?)</td><td><p>Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. </p><p></p><p>Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.</p></td></tr><tr><td>logit_bias</td><td>String (?)</td><td>Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the endoftext token from being generated.</td></tr><tr><td>user</td><td>String (?)</td><td>A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids">Learn more</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
