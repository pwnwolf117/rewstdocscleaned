# SaaS Alerts Integration Setup

To setup the SaaS Alerts integration please follow these steps:

1. Contact SaaS Alert Support to enable the REST API within your account
2. Obtain an API key by navigating to Settings > API in the SaaS Alerts dashboard, and clicking on the “Show key” button under Manage API.
3. Use the API key to authenticate requests to the API and start using our endpoints.

The documentation provides the details on the available endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication mechanism. You can learn more about the process [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/SaaS\_Alerts/external-partner-api/1.0.2).
