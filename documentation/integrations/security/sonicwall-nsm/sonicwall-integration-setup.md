# SonicWall Integration Setup

{% hint style="success" %}
**This Integration supports multiple instances**

[Check out the instructions to set up multiple instances here](../../general/multi-instance-integration/multi-instance-integration-setup.md).
{% endhint %}

To setup SonicWall NSM (Network Security Manager- SaaS) Integration with Rewst, you'll need to perform the following steps:&#x20;

### Generating a MySonicWall API Key&#x20;

1. **Log in** to [MySonicWall](https://www.mysonicwall.com/)&#x20;
2. **Navigate** to My Workspace | User Groups > User list tab.&#x20;
3. **Click** Generate My API Key on top of the table.
4. **Enter** Description, Source IP Address (optional) for the MSW API Key.
   * By the default, Validity of the key is set for 1 year. However, you can set the validity for 1 and 6 months if required.&#x20;
5. **Click** Confirm.&#x20;
6. **Click** the Copy to clipboard icon to copy the API Key.&#x20;

**Note:** MSW API key will have access and permissions as deemed by account’s user group in MySonicWall.&#x20;

**CAUTION:** You cannot view or copy the API key once you close the GENERATE API KEY pop-up window. Make sure that the API key is copied and saved.&#x20;

### Configuring the NSM Integration:

1. **Log in** to the [Rewst Platform](https://app.rewst.io/)&#x20;
2. **Click** on the "Integrations" under “Configuration” menu on the left sidebar&#x20;
3. **Click** on or search for " SonicWall NSM".&#x20;
4. **Navigate** to “Parameters” section.&#x20;
5. **Enter** the “MSW API key”
6. **Select** your “NSM Region” (the domain for the SonicWall NSM portal you log into).
   * Example of NSM regions:&#x20;
     * [https://nsm-uswest.sonicwall.com](https://nsm-uswest.sonicwall.com/)&#x20;
     * [https://nsm-eucentral.sonicwall.com](https://nsm-eucentral.sonicwall.com/)&#x20;
7. **Save** the configuration.&#x20;

Beneath that integration Parameters section, you will see the following options under Organization Mapping:&#x20;

1. Suggest Values: This option will attempt to generate mappings between Rewst organizations and child organizations in this integration.&#x20;
2. Refresh Options: This will re-read the potential mapping options – SonicWall Tenants. &#x20;
3. Save Mappings: This will apply mapping configuration changes.

#### (Optional) Enabling MySonicWall API Permission:&#x20;
