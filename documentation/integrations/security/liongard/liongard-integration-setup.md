# Liongard Integration Setup

## Liongard Integration Setup

To set up the Liongard Integration, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. **Enter** your Liongard URL. Match the prefix of the URL to your ROAR instance.
2. **Go to** your Liongard dashboard to generate an access token.
3. **Navigate** to Profile -> Account Settings -> Access Tokens -> Generate New Token -> Liongard API Token
4. **Select** "Unlimited" for the expiration time period. If unlimited is not selected, your integration may break unexpectedly when the token expires.
5. **Copy** the "Access Key ID" and "Access Key Secret" from the pop-up.
6. **Navigate** to the integrations page in Rewst.
7. **Click** on the Liongard integration.
8. **Fill out** the integration form, pasting the "Access Key ID" and "Access Key Secret" from Liongard.
9. **Submit** the form.
