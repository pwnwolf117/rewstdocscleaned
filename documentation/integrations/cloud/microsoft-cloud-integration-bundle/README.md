## Getting Started with the Bundle

***

### **Initial Setup**

1. **Login**: Access your Rewst account by navigating to the Rewst platform and logging in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to Integration Setup**: Once logged in, proceed to the dashboard, and under Configuration -> Integrations, locate the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle.
3. **Follow the Configuration Steps:** Select Integrations -> Configuration Parameters -> Tenant Permissions -> Authorize Integrations

### Step 1: Select Integrations

* **Microsoft Graph:** Enables automation of M365 services. Utilize the Microsoft Graph API to integrate M365, Entra ID, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, etc., into Rewst workflows.
* **Microsoft Exchange Online:** Facilitates automation of email and collaboration management. Access and manage mailboxes, distribution groups, and more through the Microsoft Exchange Online API within your Rewst workflows.
* **Microsoft CSP:** Aids in cloud service provider management. Through the Microsoft Partner Center API you can create & manage organizations within Rewst and provide delegated access.
* **Microsoft Azure:** Automates cloud infrastructure management. Create, read, update, and delete Azure resources using the Microsoft Azure API within Rewst workflows.

### Step 2: Configuration Parameters

Configure the Microsoft Entra App Registration that Rewst will use to interact with your Microsoft tenant. Options include:

* **Rewst Microsoft Cloud Connector:** Uses the Rewst Cloud Connector, which features dynamic permission management. Recommended for users seeking a quick & easy integration process.
* **Owned App Registration:** Use an App Registration created and managed by you within your Microsoft tenant. This is suitable for users who require or prefer maximum customization.
* **Legacy Rewst App (Deprecated):** The legacy Rewst App Registration that has a static set of permissions. This option is being deprecated in favour of our new bundle integration.
