# Rewst User Setup and GDAP Relationship Guidance

## Introduction

This guide specifically goes over the following:

* Creating the Rewst service account user.
* Creating the Rewst group that GDAP permissions will be assigned to.
* Adding the Rewst user to the AdminAgents group.
* Creating a new admin relationship with the roles specifically required by Rewst. (Depending on your current GDAP relationship setup(s) this may not be necessary as long as your relationship contains the right roles and groups are available with the necessary permissions for the user)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Other applications/your technicians might need additional roles added to the relationship. Adding new roles after the relationship has been created requires recreating the relationship.
{% endhint %}

* Adding the Rewst group to the admin relationship.
* Adding the roles for the Rewst group in the admin relationship.

{% hint style="danger" %}
IMPORTANT: As of January 2024 it was discovered that there is an issue on Microsoft's end that can cause issues with RBAC settings for certain APIs.

Because of this it is recommended to break each individual role out into seperate groups within the GDAP relationship, failure to do so can result in intermittent GET, PATCH, and POST failures on API calls.

In the video and text guide for this document the instructions state to create one group, however the document and video will be updated at a later date to reflect this.

When setting up the group(s) in Entra you should do the following:

Create a corresponding group for each role that will be assigned per [#recommended-roles-for-gdap](../authorization-best-practices.md#recommended-roles-for-gdap "mention"), an example of this would be: GDAP - Application Administrator GDAP - Exchange Administrator etc.

In the admin relationship within the Partner Center you will need to add each group to the relationship and assign the corresponding role to the corresponding group in the relationship.

Example: GDAP - Application Administrator -> Application Administrator

The user used to authorize the integration(s) will need to be a member of each of these groups.
