## **Setup Instructions**

The setup process starts within the [..](../ "mention") page. Review Initial setup and first two steps there for further information. For Azure specific permissions review step 3 below:

#### [#initial-setup](../#initial-setup "mention") ->[#step-1-select-integrations](../#step-1-select-integrations "mention") -> [#step-2-configuration-parameters](../#step-2-configuration-parameters "mention")

### **Step 3: Tenant Permissions**

* You will see a list of permissions for Graph, Exchange Online, CSP, and Azure. Necessary permissions for Azure may include:
  * **Key Vault Impersonation**
  * **Service Management User Impersonation**
  * **Storage User Impersonation**
* Recommended options are pre-selected, but you can customize based on your needs.
* Click `Next` to proceed to [Step 4](../#step-4-authorize-integration)

**Azure Authorization Note:** A key vault is required in your Azure subscription. If you receive an "Invalid Client" error message when authorizing it is likely due to a missing key vault. [Creating an empty key vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal) should resolve the issue.&#x20;

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

* **Authorization Issues**: If you encounter problems during the authorization step, ensure that you are using the correct account and that all permissions are properly set.
* **Permission Configuration Errors**: Double-check the permissions if there are issues with accessing certain functionalities. Ensure that the appropriate permissions are enabled and correctly configured.
