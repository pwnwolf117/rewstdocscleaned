# Mailgun Integration Setup

{% hint style="success" %}
**This Integration supports multiple instances**

[Check out the instructions to set up multiple instances here](../../general/multi-instance-integration/multi-instance-integration-setup.md).
{% endhint %}

## Setting up the API account

Before configuring the Rewst integration you must generate an API user.

Please refer to Mailgun's documentation for generating an API key.

## Configuring the Integration

Once you have created an API account, you will need to configure the integration within the Rewst platform.

Follow the below steps to configure a new integration:

1. **Log in** to the [Rewst platform](https://app.rewst.io/).
2. **Click** **on** the _"Integrations"_ menu on the left sidebar.
3. **Click** **on** or search for _"Mailgun"_.
4. **Complete** the form with the details you created:
   1. **Sending Domain**
   2. **API Key**
   3. **API URL**
5. **Save** the configuration.

Rewst will do a quick validation of your input.

Beneath that integration authentication section you will see the following options:

1. **Suggest Values**: This option will attempt to generate mappings between Rewst organizations and child organizations in this integration.
2. **Refresh Options**: This will re-read the potential mapping options - for both organizations and companies in Mailgun.
3. **Save Mappings**: This will apply mapping configuration changes.
