2. **Click** on the `Integrations` menu on the left sidebar.
3. **Click** on or search for `Discord`.
4. **Click** on the `Authorize` button and log into your Discord account.
5. **Select** the desired Discord server for integration.
6. **Final Authorization:** Click `Authorize` on the Discord modal to grant permissions.
7. **Save** the Integration
