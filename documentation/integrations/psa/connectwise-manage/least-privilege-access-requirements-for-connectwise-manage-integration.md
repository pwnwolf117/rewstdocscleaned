# Least Privilege Access Requirements for ConnectWise Manage Integration

### Introduction

This document provides guidance on the least privileged access required for integrating ConnectWise PSA with Rewst. The aim of this document is to provide the necessary information required to configure the integration securely and to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data leakage.

For more information on how to authenticate your ConnectWise PSA account [check out the Integration Setup page](connectwise-integration-setup.md).

### Authentication Requirements

To initiate the successful authentication of the ConnectWise PSA integration with Rewst, and pull back the list of companies you want to associate, the following permission scopes are needed:

* System → Member Maintenance: Inquire
* Companies → Company Maintenance: Inquire

### Additional Action Requirements

In addition to the above that’s required for authentication, there are several more actions the ConnectWise integration is capable of taking within Rewst. To use them all, you’ll need the following additional Security Roles configured for this account:

* Companies → Configurations: Add, Edit, Inquire
* Companies → Contacts: Add, Edit, Inquire
* Companies → Manage Attachments: Add (My), Edit (My), Delete(My), Inquire
* Companies → Team Members: Inquire

* Finance → Agreements: Inquire
* Finance → Billing View Time: Inquire: ALL _\*Required for adding billable time to tickets_

### Breakdown of Actions per Security Role

The following tables outline the various actions the ConnectWise PSA integration can take within Rewst, grouped by their security roles in ConnectWise, and each of their required permission levels to be able to execute them in workflows. We also have a generic request action, that will require any relevant scopes for what it’s being used for.
