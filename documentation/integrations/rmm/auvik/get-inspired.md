# Get Inspired

One of the most difficult parts of automation is knowing what you want to automate.

As we at Rewst always say, you cannot automate a process that doesn't already exist.

However at Rewst we strive to work with our community to help all MSPs, and our amazing community has helped us to create a list of the most common processes that MSPs automate with their integrations.

This list is by no means exhaustive, but it is a great starting point for any MSP looking to automate their processes. The items on this list are not necessarily built already but are meant as a way to _get you inspired_ (see what we did there with the page title?) to start thinking about what you want to automate.
