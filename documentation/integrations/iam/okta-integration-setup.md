# Okta Integration Setup

Here are the steps on how to create an Okta API token:

1. **Log in to the Okta Admin Console.** You will need to have administrator privileges to create API tokens.
2. **Navigate to the API section.** Click on the **Security** tab in the top navigation bar, and then click on **API** in the left sidebar.
3. **Go to the Tokens tab.** Click on the **Tokens** tab in the API section.
4. **Create a new token.** Click on the **Create Token** button.
5. **Name your token.** Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Create token** dialog box. This will help you to identify the token later.
6. **Create the token.** Click on the **Create Token** button in the dialog box.
7. **Copy the token value.** The token value will be displayed in a new dialog box. Copy the token value to your clipboard. You will need this value to authenticate your API calls.
8. **Close the dialog box.** Click on the **Ok, got it** button to close the dialog box.

**Important:**

* Make sure to copy the token value and store it in a secure location. You will not be able to view the token value again after you close the dialog box.

We'll perform a quick test to ensure that the connection to Okta is working as expected.
