# Conditional Statements and Logical Operators

## **Introduction**

In the context of Jinja templating, conditional statements and logical operators are vital tools for creating dynamic and responsive templates. This article provides an in-depth exploration of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, as well as the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` within the framework of Jinja.

### **Understanding `if`, `elif`, and `else` Statements in Jinja**

In Jinja templating, `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements function similarly to their counterparts in traditional programming languages. They enable you to control the flow of your templates based on specific conditions.

* `if` is a foundational conditional statement in Jinja. When the specified condition is true, the associated template code block within the `if` statement is executed.
* `elif` stands for "else if" and is utilized to check additional conditions after the initial `if` statement. `elif` is evaluated only if the preceding `if` statement is false.
* `else` is a fallback option. It executes a template code block when none of the preceding conditions (`if` and `elif`, if present) are true.

### **Example 1: Using `if` and `else` Statements in Jinja**

```django
{% raw %}
{%- set dogs = 1 -%}
{%- set cats = 0 -%}
{%- if dogs -%}
    {{- "we have dogs!\n" -}}
{%- else -%}
    {{- "sorry no dogs today\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if not cats -%}
    {{- "sorry, no cats today.\n" -}}
{%- else -%}
    {{- "we have cats!\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}
{% endraw %}

```

### **Example 2: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` Ladders in Jinja**

```django
{% raw %}
{%- set value = 1 -%}
{%- if value == 2 -%}
    {{- "value is 2" -}}
{%- elif value == 3 -%}
    {{- "value is 3" -}}
{%- elif value == 4 -%}
    {{- "value is 4" -}}
{%- elif value == 5 -%}
    {{- "value is 5" -}}
{%- else -%}
    {{- "value is "+value | string -}}
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}


```

{% hint style="danger" %}
While using multiple `elif` statements can be an option, it's generally not the best practice for handling numerous conditions in Jinja templates. Instead, consider using a dictionary switch for improved readability and efficiency when dealing with extensive branching logic.
{% endhint %}

### **Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, and `not` in Jinja**

Logical operators in Jinja allow you to combine multiple conditions or negate a condition.

* `and` requires all specified conditions to be true for the entire expression to be true.
* `or` requires at least one of the specified conditions to be true for the entire expression to be true.
* `not` negates a condition, making it true if the original condition is false and vice versa.

### **Example: Using Logical Operators in Jinja**

```django
{% raw %}
{%- set dogs = 1 -%}
{%- set cats = 0 -%}
{%- set lizards = 1 -%}
{%- set chickens = 0 -%}

{%- if dogs and lizards -%}
    {{- "we have both dogs and lizards.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if not cats -%}
    {{- "we have no cats.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if dogs or chickens -%}
    {{- "we have either dogs or chickens, or both, but not necessarily both.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if dogs and not chickens -%}
    {{- "we have dogs but not chickens.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if (dogs or chickens) and lizards -%}
    {{- "we have lizards and either dogs or chickens but not necessarily both.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if chickens < dogs -%}
    {{- "we have more dogs than chickens.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if lizards == dogs -%}
    {{- "we have as many lizards as dogs.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if lizards > chickens -%}
    {{- "we have more lizards than chickens.\n" -}}
{%- endif -%}
{% endraw %}
```

### **Conclusion**

In Jinja templating, mastering conditional statements and logical operators is fundamental for creating dynamic and adaptive templates. By understanding how `if`, `elif`, `else`, `and`, `or`, and `not` operate within the Jinja context, developers can craft templates that respond intelligently to various conditions, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of their templates. Always use these constructs thoughtfully to create efficient and effective Jinja templates.
