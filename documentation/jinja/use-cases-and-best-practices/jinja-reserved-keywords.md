# Jinja Reserved Keywords

## Overview
​
This document is intended to provide an overview of Jinja's reserved keywords Rewst users will encounter while building their own automations, and addresses a common TypeError issue that users face when conflicts occur.​

---
## List of Reserved Keywords
​
### Control Structures
- `if`, `elif`, `else`: Conditional statements
- `for`: Looping through sequences
- `while`: Loop based on a condition
- `try`, `except`, `finally`: Exception handling
- `with`: Context management
​
### Variables and Data Types
- `True`, `False`: Boolean values
- `None`: Represents null value
- `del`: Deletes a variable
​
### Functions and Definitions
- `def`: Function definition
- `return`: Returns a value from a function
- `yield`: Produces a generator
- `lambda`: Anonymous function
- `class`: Defines a class
​
### Operators and Keywords
- `and`, `or`, `not`: Logical operators
- `in`, `is`: Comparison operators
- `raise`: Raise an exception
- `assert`: Assertion statement
- `break`, `continue`: Loop control
- `pass`: Null operation
- `global`, `nonlocal`: Scope specifiers
​
### Built-in Methods
- `split`: Splits a string into a list
- `items`: Returns a list of dictionary's key-value tuple pairs
- `replace`: Replaces a string with another string
- `get`: Retrieves the value of a dictionary key
- `result`, `results`:  Used in Rewst to store outputs. Note that these are not built-in methods, they're used in Rewst as variable named to store outputs and should not cause issues.
​
### Imports and Modules
- `import`: Importing modules
- `from`: Specifies what attributes to import from a module

## Common Error: JSON Serialization Issue
​
### Error:
​
`JSON cannot serialize 'builtin_function_or_method': <built-in method items of dict object at 0x7f618cb407c0>`
​
### Solution:
​
Ensure that you're not inadvertently referencing a built-in method like `items` as an object when you actually intend to use its output. Execute the method first before attempting to serialize it to JSON.
​
#### Example:
​
If the output of an API call stores all the items in a key named `items`, reference it like this:
​
```
{{CTX.customers.data["items"]}}
```
​
This ensures that you're referencing the actual data rather than the built-in `items` method, thus avoiding the serialization issue.

## Best Practices
​
- Always prefix your own variables and function names to avoid collision with these reserved words.
- Use these words in the appropriate context to ensure readability and maintainability.
​
## Conclusion
​
Understanding these protected words in Jinja is critical for effective template development. Familiarize yourself with these terms to write better, error-free code.
