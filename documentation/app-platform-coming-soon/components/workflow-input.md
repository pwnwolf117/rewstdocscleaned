# Workflow Input

## Introduction

Welcome to the Workflow Input component documentation! As part of the page builder in App Platform, the Workflow Input component allows you to integrate interactive forms or fields that capture user inputs essential for triggering and controlling workflows within your web applications.

## Why we developed it

The Workflow Input component facilitates the collection of user inputs that directly influence the behavior of automated processes or workflows. This component ensures that data-driven workflows are both responsive and adaptable to user interactions, thereby increasing the efficiency and relevance of automated services.

## What it could be used for

* Gathering parameters before executing a workflow, such as user preferences or specific requirements.
* Allowing users to initiate workflows that require real-time data, such as support ticket submissions or service requests.
* Enabling configuration changes that affect how services are delivered, such as scheduling backups or setting notification preferences.
* Facilitating user interactions that trigger complex sequences of tasks, enhancing dynamic response capabilities.

## **Example \ Use Case**

In an MSPâ€™s client management system, the Workflow Input component might be used on a service configuration page where clients can enter their preferences for data backup servicesâ€”choices like backup frequency, data cap, and specific folders to include. These inputs could then directly trigger a personalized backup workflow, ensuring that the service aligns perfectly with the client's specified needs. This approach not only automates the process based on real-time inputs but also enhances user satisfaction by providing customized service delivery.

## Adding Workflow Input to your page

1. **Access the Canvas**: Open the page you're working on in edit mode, in App Platform.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Locate the 'Workflow Input' component in the component library, then drag and drop it onto the canvas.

## Configuring the Workflow Input component

1. **Select the component**: Click on the added 'Workflow Input' component to select it.
2. **Properties Panel**: On the properties panel, you'll find various configurable options:
   * Workflow Input Settings
     * **Input Label**: Define the label for the input.
     * **Input Type**: Define the type of the expected input; 'Text' or 'Slider'.
     * **Input Variant**: Define the variant of expected input; 'Standard', "Outlined' or 'Filled'.
     * **Input Variabl**e: Define the input variable.
3. **Live Preview**: The canvas provides a live preview of your configured component(s) once you've made changes.
