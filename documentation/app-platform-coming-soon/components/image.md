# Image

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image component documentation! As part of the page builder in App Platform, the Image component allows you to integrate visual content into your web applications. This component is essential for enhancing the visual appeal, conveying information visually, and\or supporting the textual content within your applications.

## Why we developed it

The Image component provides a straightforward and effective way to include images in your applications, which can be crucial for branding, user engagement, and instructional purposes. Images help to break up text, make pages more engaging, and can be used to illustrate concepts or guide users more intuitively than text alone.&#x20;

## What it could be used for

* Showcasing product features or service details.
* Enhancing blog posts or articles with relevant visuals.
* Creating a more engaging user interface with graphical elements.
* Displaying logos or other branding materials to strengthen identity.

## **Example \ Use Case**

An MSP might use the Image component to enhance a tutorial page on their client portal. By incorporating screenshots and diagrams, they can visually guide clients through the steps to set up a VPN or configure email settings on various devices. This not only makes the instructions clearer and more accessible but also reduces the cognitive load on users, potentially decreasing the number of support calls and increasing client satisfaction with the self-service options provided.

## Adding an Image to your page

1. **Access the Canvas**: Open the page you're working on in edit mode, in App Platform.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Locate the 'Image' component in the component library, then drag and drop it onto the canvas.

## Configuring the Image component

   * **Open link as new tab**: Toggle to open the Link URL in a new tab.
   * **In-line styles**: Define custom CSS properties for the component.&#x20;
