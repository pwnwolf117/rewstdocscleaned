# Themes

### Introduction

Welcome to the App Platform Themes documentation! This guide will walk you through the process of managing themes for your app pages within Rewst. Themes provide a powerful way to customize the look and feel of your app, and we follow the Material UI (MUI) theming principles.

### Applying Themes

Themes are applied globally to all app pages. Here's how you can manage and customize them:

1. **Access Page Builder**: Navigate to the Page Builder of the app page you want to customize.
2. **Open Theme Options**: On the right side of the screen, click on the palette icon. This will open the right drawer, revealing theme options.

#### Theme Options

Within the right drawer, you'll find three tabs at the bottom: Palette, Typography, and Editor.

**Palette Tab**

1. **Generate Theme from Icon**: Choose an icon to generate a theme based on its colors.
2. **MUI Classes Colors**: Customize colors for different Material UI (MUI) classes.
3. **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark mode for your app.

**Typography Tab**

1. **Font and General Settings**: Adjust the font and other general settings for each type class (h1, h2, etc.).

**Editor Tab**

1. **Direct CSS Editing**: For advanced customization, edit the CSS directly in the Editor tab.

### Why Customize Themes?

Customizing themes allows you to create a unique and branded visual experience for your app. Following Material UI theming principles ensures a consistent and user-friendly design across your app pages.

### Important Considerations

1. **Consistency**: Aim for a consistent look and feel across your app by applying themes globally.
2. **Usability**: Prioritize usability and readability when customizing typography.
3. **CSS Editing Caution**: If you choose to edit CSS directly, exercise caution to avoid unintended side effects.

### Saving Changes

Remember to save your changes after customizing the theme to ensure they take effect.
