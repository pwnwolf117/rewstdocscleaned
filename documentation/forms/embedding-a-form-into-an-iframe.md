# Embedding a Form into an iFrame

### Embedding Forms

There is often a need to embed a form in an iframe to give users the ability to complete a form and trigger automation. The form can be embedded into other web pages that use iFrame Links.

{% hint style="success" %}
To get the dynamic form URL, make sure your form is already set up as a Trigger for a Workflow.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to get the embeddable link:

1. **Go to** your account in [Rewst](https://app.rewst.io/).

3. **Click** on the Workflow that includes the Form Trigger.
4. **Click** on _Edit Trigger_ in the top menu.
5. **Click** on _Copy Embeddable iFrame code._
