# Adding Time Saved to a Workflow

One of the key metrics you can use to understand the value added by your automations is time saved. You can configure this in Rewst by identifying how long it takes to manually work through your process before automating it and adding it into your workflow.

**Considerations for Time Saved**

When determining how much time to set for any given process, it's a good practice to consider not only how much time it may take you or your most experienced tech to go through that process manually, but also how much time it takes to fix any human errors that may happen during this process.
