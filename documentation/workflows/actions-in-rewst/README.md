# Actions in Rewst

In Rewst, Actions are the tasks or operations available for creating and automating workflows. They are accessible from a side panel and sorted based on their respective sources, including Integrations, Core, Rewst, Transform, and Workflow.

Each Action serves a unique purpose and comes with a brief description to aid in understanding its functionality. These categories and Actions will be explored in more detail in the subsequent pages.

* **Integrations**: When you set up an integration in Rewst, it comes with a predefined set of Actions. These Actions allow you to work with various parts of the integrated product as per its API. Check the [individual integration setup pages](../../integrations/) for more information on available Actions.
* **Core**: These are the essential platform components like webhooks, email dispatching, and no-ops (no operations). For more information, visit the [Core Actions](core-actions.md) page.
* **Rewst**: These Actions are for interacting with your Rewst environment. You can perform tasks such as creating organizations and users, associating with multi-tenanted objects, and setting organization variables. For more details on these Actions, visit the [Rewst Actions](rewst-actions/) page.
* **Transform**: These Actions help you shape and modify your data for efficient workflow execution, replacing the need for complex Jinja statements. In-depth details for how and when to use various transforms are provided on the [Transform Actions](transform-actions/) page.
* **Workflow**: These Actions allow you to call other workflows within your environment. They enable you to feed information from the parent workflow as inputs and return the results upon completion.

Each Action serves a unique purpose, with a brief description to help you understand its functionality. Let's explore these categories and Actions in greater detail on the following pages.
