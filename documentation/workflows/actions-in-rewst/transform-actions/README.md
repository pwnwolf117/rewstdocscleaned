# Transform Actions

With Jinja2 templating, you have powerful capabilities at your fingertips to shape and manipulate data to fit your needs. But sometimes these actions are common enough to repeat over and over. This is where transforms come in!

## Overview

Data transformation actions provide you the ability to modify, combine, and reshape the data you are working with in your workflows. These actions are particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures, such as nested lists and objects. They empower you to transform data according to your needs without any coding necessary. In the following sections, we will guide you on how to use these actions for some of the newest actions currently in beta:

***

{% content-ref url="restructure-lists.md" %}
[restructure-lists.md](restructure-lists.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="set-field-value.md" %}
[set-field-value.md](set-field-value.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="convert-to-object.md" %}
[convert-to-object.md](convert-to-object.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="process-with-items-results.md" %}
[process-with-items-results.md](process-with-items-results.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="merge-lists.md" %}
[merge-lists.md](merge-lists.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="diff-lists.md" %}
[diff-lists.md](diff-lists.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Using the above actions, you can perform a myriad of transformations on your data, allowing for a more flexible and dynamic approach to workflow creation.
