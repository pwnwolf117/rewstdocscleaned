## Considerations When Migrating

When officially migrating to offboarding v2 various items should be taken into consideration as part of this process. Below is a common list of actionable items to consider when migrating to v2 of the offboarding crate.

* Disabling workflow triggers for v1 of the offboarding crate
* Updating any workflow wrappers or completion handlers (aka workflow listeners) to utilize v2 of the offboarding crate
* Update references to the v1 form. For example, this may include any workflows that add form links to tickets
* Update any custom forms that currently utilize v1 to be compatible with and utilize v2
