# Configure Organization Variables

### Introduction

An organization variable is a universal setting that applies across your MSP Rewst Organization and your Client's organizations. Organization variables are used to apply values at the organization and sub-org layers. They are referenced in workflows using the syntax `{{ ORG.VARIABLES. }}`.&#x20;

Sub-organizations can inherit organization variables unless a sub-org has the same variable defined, which will override the value.

The Configure Organizational Variables crate is used to help you set the essential variables that will allow Rewst prebuilt crates to work.

### Installation

1. **Go to** _Crates_ → _Crate Marketplace._
2. **Select** _Configure Organizational Variables_ and follow the unpacking steps.
