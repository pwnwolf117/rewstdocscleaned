# Document M365 Groups Setup

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that this documentation applies to the v2 of this crate.

The original crate documented against an asset called "M365 Groups (auto)", the new version uses "MS365 Groups (auto)" instead.

It is recommended that you disable the trigger on the old automations and delete the flexible asset types to avoid confusion.
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

The "Document M365 GroupInformation" crate is a handy automation tool designed to streamline the documentation of all group information in Microsoft 365. It records details such as group type, visibility type, mail-enabled vs security enabled etc.

The purpose of this crate is to automate the process of group management, auditing, reporting, and overall IT administration. The automation benefits include improved reporting accuracy, time-saving through automated documentation, and easy troubleshooting with readily available group information. Out of date documentation provided little benefit, so this ensures that automated documentation is constantly dynamically updated.

Before using this automation, ensure you have an existing Microsoft 365 account and your ITGlue or Hudu integration is set up.

## What Does the Automation Do?

The automation fetches user details from the Microsoft 365 API and documents this information on your ITGlue platform. The automation also links the M365 Group members to the Contact Record in ITG for easier tagging and access.

The benefits include:

* Automated documentation saving you considerable time.
* Enhanced internal reporting and auditing with systematically documented user information.
* Easy troubleshooting due to readily available user data.

## Compatibility

This automation is compatible with ITGlue at the moment, and we are actively working on integrating it with Hudu.

If your system or platform is not on this list, please let us know. We'll explore whether it can integrate with our crate.

## Automation Steps

1. The automation fetches group details from various integrations such as MS Graph.
2. The information is combined into a single JSON object containing all the information about that user, including group names, group members, type of group etc.
3. The information is then updated, or creates a new flexible asset and uses a HTML table to insert the information in a nice-to-look-at way.
4. The group members are then related to the contact record.
