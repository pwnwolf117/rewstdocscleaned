## Crate Overview

This crate is designed to streamline the process of mapping and managing organization variables across different integrations configured in Rewst. It includes two key workflows:

1. **\[ROC] Rewst: Get All Integration Ids**
2. **get\_org\_ids**

### High-Level Data Flow

* The parent workflow, `[ROC] Rewst: Get All Integration Ids`, begins by listing all organizations within Rewst, gathering their respective integrations.
* It then triggers the `get_org_ids` subworkflow for each organization ID, as specified in `{{CTX.all_org_ids}}`.
  * This execution is done using the `Run As Org` setting, ensuring that the subworkflow processes data in the context of each specific organization.

### Subworkflow Processing

* Inside the `get_org_ids` subworkflow:
  * **Task 1**: Sets up the base for integration mapping with `org_variables`, establishing a foundational dictionary that maps integration names to their Rewst variable names.
  * **Task 2**: Fetches the Microsoft Tenant ID (`ms_tenant_id`) for the specific organization in focus. This is a key piece of data that will be included in the final integration mapping.
  * **Task 3**: Constructs a comprehensive mapping of integration IDs (`integration_ids`), using the previously fetched `ms_tenant_id` and other relevant organization data.

### Data Aggregation and Output

* Upon completion of the subworkflow for each organization, the parent workflow receives the raw results (`unformated_ids`).
* These results are then aggregated into a single, comprehensive list of integration IDs across all organizations (`all_integration_ids`).

## Workflow Breakdown: **`[ROC] Rewst: Get All Integration Ids`**

### **Action**: [List Organization](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/workflows/actions-in-rewst/rewst-actions/organization-actions#list-organizations)

* **Input Parameters**: None specified; lists all organizations in Rewst.
  * **Data Alias:** `all_org_ids` stores the list of returned results.

### **Action**: [List Integrations for Organization](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/workflows/actions-in-rewst/rewst-actions/integrations-and-external-association-actions#list-integrations-for-organization)

* **Input Parameters**:
  * `org_id`: Uses `{{ ORG.ATTRIBUTES.id }}` to fetch integrations for the current organization.

### Action: Executes the `get_org_ids` subworkflow.

* **Purpose**: To process integration data for each organization.
* **Run As Org**: Utilizes `{{item()}}` to run the subworkflow in the context of each organization in `{{CTX.all_org_ids}}`.
* **With Items Configuration**:
  * Iterates over `{{CTX.all_org_ids}}` to run the subworkflow for each organization.
  * Uses `{{ CTX.installed_integrations }}` as input to provide installed integrations for each organization.
  * `concurrency` set to "7" for parallel processing.
* **Output**:
  * Data Alias `unformated_ids`: Collects raw subworkflow results.
  * Data Alias `all_integration_ids`: Aggregates comprehensive integration IDs mappings.

## Subworkflow Breakdown: `get_org_ids`

### **Action**: `noop`

* **Purpose**: Starts the subworkflow.
* **Data Alias:** `org_variables`: Mapping dictionary for integration names to Rewst variable names.

### **Rewst Action**: [**Get External Reference**](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/workflows/actions-in-rewst/rewst-actions/integrations-and-external-association-actions#get-external-reference)

* **Input Parameters**:
  * `identifier`: `ms_tenant_id`
  * `org_id`: `{{ ORG.ATTRIBUTES.id }}`
* **Data Alias:** `ms_tenant_id` stores the result of the action.

### **Action**: `noop`

* **Purpose:** Custom Logic in Data Alias designed to create a comprehensive mapping of integration IDs for each organization, considering various variables and conditions.
* **Data Alias:** `integration_ids` maps integration IDs to the organization.

**Jinja Template**:

```django
{{-
        {
        "rewst_name": ORG.ATTRIBUTES.name,
        "rewst_id": ORG.ATTRIBUTES.id,
          **{
            integration.ref: ORG.VARIABLES[CTX.org_variables[integration.ref]] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_client_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_tenant_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref.replace("_", "")+"_org_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_company_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_account_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_site_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_customers"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_org_domain"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref.replace("_rmm", "")+"_org_id"]|d
            for integration in CTX.installed_integrations
            if ORG.VARIABLES[CTX.org_variables[integration.ref]] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_client_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_tenant_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref.replace("_", "")+"_org_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_company_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_account_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_site_id"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_customers"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref+"_org_domain"] 
              or ORG.VARIABLES[integration.ref.replace("_rmm", "")+"_org_id"]|d
            },
          **{ 
            "m365": CTX.ms_tenant_id.result.reference_id
            for tenant in range(0,1)
            if CTX.ms_tenant_id.result.reference_id
            }
        }
-}}
```

### **Jinja Logic Explanation**

* **Organization Attributes**:
  * `rewst_name`: Retrieves the name of the organization from its attributes.
  * `rewst_id`: Retrieves the unique ID of the organization.
* **Integration Mapping**:
  * This portion constructs a dictionary for each integration within the organization.
  * `integration.ref`: Represents the reference name of each integration.
  * The template checks multiple variables for each integration (like `"_client_id"`, `"_tenant_id"`, `"_org_id"`, etc.) and assigns the first found value to the integration's reference name.
  * It uses a conditional (`if`) statement to include only those integrations where relevant variables are found.
* **Microsoft Tenant ID Mapping**:
  * Adds the Microsoft Tenant ID (`"m365"`) to the mapping, using the result from the previous "get\_foreign\_object\_reference" task.
  * The loop (`for tenant in range(0,1)`) is designed to include this mapping only if the `ms_tenant_id` is found.

### Output

* The output is a nested dictionary with each organization’s name and ID, along with a detailed mapping of all their integrations and specific attributes like client IDs, tenant IDs, etc.
* This structured output is crucial for workflows that need to understand and manipulate data across multiple integrations and platforms within Rewst.
